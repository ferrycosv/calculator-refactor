## DOM

| tag name | attributes | role |

| __span__ | id="result" | show the result of the calculation on the screen |
| __input type="text"__ | id="inputbox1" | capture the input value of the first number to operate |
| __input type="text"__ | id="inputbox2" | capture the input value of the second number to operate |
| __select__ | id="operation" | dropdown to select the operation to perform |
| __button__ | id="btncalculate" | button to execute the arithmetic operation between the two input values |
